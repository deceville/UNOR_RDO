                Occidental Recoletos (UNO-R), Bacolod City. This annual multi-disciplinary Journal, published by the
                Research and Development Office, commits to serve as the cradle where excellence is conceptualized and
                nurtured. It is the information bank that is dedicated to promote knowledge in the various disciplines
                in the University.
                It also serves as the vehicle through which UNO-R realizes its commitment “to extend the frontiers of
                knowledge through experimentation and verification” in order to deepen the evaluation of problems
                towards the synthesis of faith, reason, culture, and life. As a tool for development, it provides the
                framework and support system that will propel the UNO-R community to evolve continuously towards
                technological, social, economic, political, and moral advancement until excellence is achieved.
                This Journal is envisioned to publish the research outputs that manifest the EXCELLENCE that every UNO
                Rian heart and mind embodies.
